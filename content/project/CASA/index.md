CASA is a feasibility study to explore the use of wearable sensor-triggered ecological momentary assessments and electronic patient-reported outcomes in a home-based palliative care setting. We collected data from patients and their primary caregivers. As the long-term aspiration is to enable palliative care patients to stay at home longer, we called this study CASA (Continuous Assessment and Support Alerts).

We wrote a blog about our motivation behind CASA: [link TODO]().

The full manuscript entitled 'Wearable-triggered ecological momentary assessments are feasible in people with advanced cancer and their family caregivers: Feasibility study from an outpatient palliative care clinic at a cancer centre' has been published in the *Journal of Palliative Medicine* in March 2023 (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37134212/).

We also published a [letter-to-the-editor](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/epdf/10.1089/jpm.2022.0125) in the same journal focusing on the sleep aspects.

Building on the CASA feasibility study we are in the process of setting up a study to collect wearable data from patients and caregivers at a much larger scale. We plan to use artificial intelligence (AI) methods to identify “yellow flag” patterns. If successful, we would then test a proactive support intervention triggered by “yellow flags” in a multi-site, randomised trial.

The following figure demonstrates an example “yellow flag” pattern captured. This and all other collected EMA responses can be viewed in an *Interactive App* at https://thiloschuler.shinyapps.io/casa-pilot/. For data privacy reason a dynamic random time shift is applied.
