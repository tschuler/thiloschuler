CASA is a pilot project to test the feasiblity of wearable sensor-triggered ecological momentary assessments and electronic patient-reported outcomes in a home-based palliative care setting. We collected data from patients and their primary caregivers. As the long-term aspiration is to keep palliative care patients longer we called this study CASA (Continuous Assessment and Support Alerts).

The full manuscript entitled 'Wearable-triggered ecological momentary assessments are feasible in people with advanced cancer and their family caregivers: Feasibility study from an outpatient palliative care clinic at a cancer centre' has been published in the *Journal of Palliative Medicine* in March 2023 (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37134212/).
