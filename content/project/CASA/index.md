CASA is a pilot project to test the feasiblity of wearable sensor-triggered ecological momentary assessments and electronic patient-reported outcomes in a home-based palliative care setting. We collected data from patients and their primary caregivers.

The full manuscript entitled 'Wearable-triggered ecological momentary assessments are feasible in people with advanced cancer and their family caregivers: Feasibility study from an outpatient palliative care clinic at a cancer centre' has been accepted in the Journal of Palliative Medicine in March 2023.
