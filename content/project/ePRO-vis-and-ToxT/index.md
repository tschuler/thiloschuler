In this project we are exploring **longitudinal ePRO analysis** methods and **visualisation techniques** that can **capture toxicity-over-time (ToxT)** and provide meaningful benefit to routine care treatment decisions, clinical research and shared decision making with our patients.

We are building on the work of **below leaders** to bring routine and longitudinal ePRO collection into **Radiation Oncology**. ePROs and ToxT monitoring are provide novel opportunities to improve care given the importance of late toxicity in Radiation Oncology.

* [Ethan Basch](https://unclineberger.org/directory/ethan-basch/)'s ongoing landmark work has establisehd electronic patient-reported outcomes (ePROs) in oncology with a focus on Medical Oncology, which is also evident in the [PRO-CTCAE system](https://healthcaredelivery.cancer.gov/pro-ctcae/).

* [Amylou Dueck](https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/dueck-amylou-c-ph-d/bio-00092346) and her team at Mayo are pioneeing new ePRO analysis methods such as composite scoring for PRO-CTCAE and baseline adjustment.

* [Gita Thanarajasingam](https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/thanarajasingam-gita-m-d/bio-20400655) is highlighting the importance of capturing toxicity-over-time (ToxT) as more and more oncological conditions become a "chronic disease". Her focus is Haematology.

At [FROGG 2022](https://frogg.com.au/) we are presenting **acute toxicity data from a real-world RCT** ([poster](/pdf/FROGG_2022_Poster-Schuler-Final.pdf)). These data were captured by weekly ePROs based on the [REQUITE](https://www.requite.eu/). Clinical trial staff did not actively "chase" patients regarding completion.

An accompanying **demo app** ([link](https://thiloschuler.shinyapps.io/FROGG-2022-demo/)) shows some early and evolving work to quantify ToxT (using the [ProAE](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ProAE/index.html) package from the Mayo team), which will be particularly relevant for late toxicity analysis. We also experiment with 'Alluvial' (aka 'Sankey') charts using the [easyalluvial](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/easyalluvial/index.html) package.
