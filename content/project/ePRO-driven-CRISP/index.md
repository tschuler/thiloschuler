This collaborative project between the [Radiation Oncology department at Northern Sydney Cancer Centre](https://www.nslhd.health.nsw.gov.au/RadiationOncology/Pages/default.aspx) and the community organisation [Canteen](https://www.canteen.org.au/) developed and successfully implemented an ePRO-driven process to identify and offer referral to Canteen's services (psychosocial support for families) and the Quitline service (smoking cessation). Electronic patient-reported outcomes (ePROs) enabled systematic and sustainable screening, while a new clinical role, the Patient Care Radiation Therapist (PCRT), provided a human support element.
