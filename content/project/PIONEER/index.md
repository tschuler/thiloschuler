summary: This project aimed to establish more modern and patient-centred palliative radiotherapy (RT). It clinically implemented a simulation avoidance appraoch, which we called simulation-free RT (SFRT), which uses standard image-guidance (IGRT) equipment and we started routine collection of electronic patient-reported outcomes (ePROs) in this challenging patient group.

This project aimed to establish routinely-collected electronic patient-reported outcomes (ePROs) as a component of patient-centred palliative radiotherapy (RT). Other patient-centred innovations are a streamlined approach that uses image-guidance to omit a dedicated planning/simulation CT scan if certain pre-conditions are met and the use of intensity-modulated techniques if the prescribing radiation oncologist feels this is of benefit. We called this novel technique *Simulation-free Radiation Therapy (SFRT)*.

Implementation and initial clinical outcomes of this patient-centred palliative RT approach is described in the [initial publication](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/347335096_Introducing_Computed_Tomography_Simulation-Free_and_Electronic_Patient-Reported_Outcomes-Monitored_Palliative_Radiation_Therapy_into_Routine_Care_Clinical_Outcomes_and_Implementation_Experience). 

After treating 1000 consecutive SFRT courses we comprehensively updated our results including a propensity score-matched comparison to a local contemporariy cohort that received conventionally simulated palliative RT: [SFRT-1000 Publication in Red Journal (open access)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2024.09.041).

The [letter-to-the-editor](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/342071760_Patient-reported_outcome_measures_PROMs_in_palliative_radiotherapy) in the Green Journal highlights our routine care ePRO experience including our approach to overcome undisputable challenges when using ePROs in unwell palliative RT patients. It also points out severral opportunties of this technology that, in our mind, make routine introduction of ePROs as part of palliative RT a highly worthwhile investment.

A [letter-to-the-editor](https://thiloschuler.me/pdf/2022-InternationalJournalofRadiationOncologyBiologyPhysics-SCHULER_RegardRoos.pdf) in the Red Journal updated our results after more than 500 patients treated on this pathway. It also describes simulation avoidance as a viable, and arguably in certain situations preferred alternative to the 'Rapid Access Clinic' paradigm originally developed in Canada.
