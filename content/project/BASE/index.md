wePRO BASE is a prospective real-world cohort study investigating whether baseline data from consumer-grade **wearable sensors** and from electronic patient-reported outcome (**ePRO**) surveys can complement clinician-rated performance status in terms of predicting relevant oncological outcomes such as hospitalisation, toxicity and survival. BASE stands for Baseline Ability Status Evaluation.

This ethics-approved study was conducted at the [Radiation Oncology department](https://www.nslhd.health.nsw.gov.au/Cancer/radiation-oncology/Pages/Radiation-oncology-treatment-journey.aspx) of the Northern Sydney Cancer Centre (NSCC) located at Royal North Shore Hospital (RNSH) in Sydney. Using a pragmatic recruitment approach we aimed to offer a wearable sensor to every patient receiving radiotherapy.

Between June 2022 and January 2024 we enrolled **n = 751** patients, which constitutes the **largest, non-pooled wearable device study in oncology** based on a recent systemic review by [Chow et al.](https://academic.oup.com/oncolo/article/29/4/e419/7424533) We are currently analysing the data for the first clinical paper, which we anticipate to be published in 2025.

Huge thanks to all participating patients, to the facilitating NSCC staff and the following two funding sources:
* Seed funding from Sydney Vital (now part of [Sydney Health Partners](https://sydneyhealthpartners.org.au/)), which enabled purchasing of wearable devices
* Donation from the [RNSH Pink Ladies](https://www.nslhd.health.nsw.gov.au/News/Pages/Pinkladiesawardedbylocalmp.aspx) to support the data analysis
