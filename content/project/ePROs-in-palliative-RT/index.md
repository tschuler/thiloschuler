This project aims to establish routinely-collected electronic patient-reported outcomes (ePROs) as a component of patient-centred palliative radiotherapy (RT). Other patient-centred innovations are a novel, streamlined approach that uses image-guidance to omit a dedicated planning scan if certain pre-conditions are met and the use of intensity-modulated techniques if the prescribing radiation oncologist feels this is of benefit. 

Implementation and clinical outcomes of this patient-centred palliative RT approach is described in the [main publication](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/347335096_Introducing_Computed_Tomography_Simulation-Free_and_Electronic_Patient-Reported_Outcomes-Monitored_Palliative_Radiation_Therapy_into_Routine_Care_Clinical_Outcomes_and_Implementation_Experience).

The [letter-to-the-editor](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/342071760_Patient-reported_outcome_measures_PROMs_in_palliative_radiotherapy) of the Green Journal highlights our routine care ePRO experience including our approach to overcome undisputable challenges when using ePROs in unwell palliative RT patients. It also points out severral opportunties of this technology that, in our mind, make routine introduction of ePROs as part of palliative RT a highly worthwhile investment.
