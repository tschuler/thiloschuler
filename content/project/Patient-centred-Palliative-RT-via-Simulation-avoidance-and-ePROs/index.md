summary: This project aimed to establish more modern and patient-centred palliative radiotherapy (RT). It clinically implemented a simulation avoidance appraoch using standard image-guidance (IGRT) equipment and started routine collection of electronic patient-reported outcomes (ePROs) in this challenging patient group.

This project aimed to establish routinely-collected electronic patient-reported outcomes (ePROs) as a component of patient-centred palliative radiotherapy (RT). Other patient-centred innovations are a novel, streamlined approach that uses image-guidance to omit a dedicated planning/simulation CT scan if certain pre-conditions are met and the use of intensity-modulated techniques if the prescribing radiation oncologist feels this is of benefit. 

Implementation and clinical outcomes of this patient-centred palliative RT approach is described in the [main publication](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/347335096_Introducing_Computed_Tomography_Simulation-Free_and_Electronic_Patient-Reported_Outcomes-Monitored_Palliative_Radiation_Therapy_into_Routine_Care_Clinical_Outcomes_and_Implementation_Experience).

The [letter-to-the-editor](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/342071760_Patient-reported_outcome_measures_PROMs_in_palliative_radiotherapy) in the Green Journal highlights our routine care ePRO experience including our approach to overcome undisputable challenges when using ePROs in unwell palliative RT patients. It also points out severral opportunties of this technology that, in our mind, make routine introduction of ePROs as part of palliative RT a highly worthwhile investment.

A [letter-to-the-editor (accepted)]() in the Red Journal updated our results after more than 500 patients treated on this pathway. It also describes simulation avoidance as a viable, and arguably in certain situations preferred alternative to the 'Rapid Access Clinic' paradigm originally developed in Canada.
