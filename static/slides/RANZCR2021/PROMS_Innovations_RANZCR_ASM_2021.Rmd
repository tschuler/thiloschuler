# Journey

.pull-left[
### 2016
* **Onsite ePRO** collection (iPad in waiting room) 
* Completion rates (35-59%; ASM 2017) too low.

### 2017
* **Offsite ePRO**: No commercial vendor
* Re-Discovery of **REDCap** as "ePRO survey engine" (survey designer & API)

### 2018
* Re-implementation of in-house clinical research system enabling REDCap **Integration**

#### Superset of international [REQUITE](https://requite.eu/) consortium's questionnaire:
* **Baseline** (ePRO prior to new patient appointment)
* **Peri-treatment** (abridged; weekly ePRO during and in first month post RT)
* **Follow-up** (6 monthly ePRO)

# ePRO Innovations

#### Toxicity monitoring over time 
  * Longitudinal (late) toxicity monitoring ‚û°Ô∏è more relieable including less interrater issues with **ePROs**.
  * Trend for hypo#/SBRT with acute symptom peaks post RT course ‚û°Ô∏è remote **ePROs** +/- alerts can capture them and trigger actions.  
  
#### Safe, risk-adapted remote follow-up

* Even before COVID-19 we had started to integrate **ePROs** into our phone follow-up program 
* We are working on an **ePRO**-only approach under certain circumstances

#### Embedded, pragmatic real-world clinical trials

* Our ongoing in-house prostate cancer RCT (def. hypo# vs SBRT) has recruited n=188 pts in 2 years 
* Without **ePROs** this wouldn't have been possible in a small 3 linac department.

#### Innovative care pathways 
* Recent presentation on **ePRO**-driven referral pathway to community services
* Slides and **video** here: [https://thiloschuler.me/project/epro-driven-crisp](https://thiloschuler.me/project/epro-driven-crisp)

# Conclusion 

### Routine care ePROs are .highlight[challenging on multiple levels], but definitely .highlight[feasible] and well worth the effort as they open .highlight[exciting opportunities] to improve the care for our patients.
